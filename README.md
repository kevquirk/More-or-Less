# MoreOrLess WordPress Theme

## Theme demo: [https://kevq.uk](https://kevq.uk)

## Introduction
MoreOrLess is a minimal WordPress theme that is based on the brilliant [Less theme by Jared Erickson](http://jarederickson.com/less-a-free-super-minimal-wordpress-theme). MoreOrLess isn't just a re-skin of Jared's theme though, I have also added a number of additional features that I think add useability, without adding too much bloat.

## Features
Some of the features I've added over and above what Jared originally coded are:
* Improved typography using Google Fonts
* Fixed colour/font issues with ul/li tags.
* Improved header formatting.
* Changed theme colours - also added additional blue and dark blue theme (see wiki for instruction on how to change the theme).
* Better formatting of blockquotes.
* Added published date to posts.
* Added current year to footer.
* Added FontAwesome support.
* Added support for sub-menus.
* Increased width of main container to 790px.
* Added a 404 page.

## License
The original license of the Less theme has been released under the GNU GPL, Jared also says in the comments on his blog that he's fine for people to adapt the theme, as long as they provide attribution. So with that, I have released this theme under the [Creative Commons Attribution ï¿½ Share Alike 4.0 License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0)
